# iOS app version 1.0.0 published to the App Store 3/19/23
## Functionality
* Login to a website on iOS device (i.e. Mobile Safari) using Connect-with-Mee. 
* No password is required and your login event is not tracked by a third-party (e.g. Apple, Google, Facebook, etc).
* Uses iOS FaceID (or TouchID) for user authentication.
## Issues and bugs
* No built-in backup capability. We rely on the user backing up their iOS device.
* If the user deletes the Mee app and reinstalls it then the user will end up logging back into a site/app with a new/different OpenID identifier.
* The user is not able to initiate the Connect-with-Mee flow from the Mee app. To walk through the Connect-with-Mee flow, it is necessary to install the app, type a real partner website address (https://mee.foundation) or a demo partner website address (https://oldeyorktimes.com) in a mobile browser, click the Connect-with-Mee button on any of the mentioned websites. 
* http->https redirect for the demo partner website doesn’t work. It is necessary to type https://oldeyorktimes.com in a mobile browser search bar to ensure that the Connect-with-Mee flow will go smoothly.
* Cross-device user flow is not available.
* Redirect to restore the context of the OIDC request is disabled.
* UI bugs on the Consent Screen (low priority for now).
* No wizard screens to guide the user through the flow.
